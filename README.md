# KOBAS issues for Pivotal Tracker

This Chrome extension for Pivotal Tracker makes it very easy to see which of your stories are labeled as issues. 

Any of story with a label that contains the string 'issue' will be displayed with a green bug icon.

This is a fork of Kimberly Johnson's original extension for Charters, repurposed for KOBAS needs.
